      "Best: OILY SKIN TYPE I'm gonna give two, it's hard to pick favorites. Shiseido Synchro Skin and Lancome 24-hr Teint Idole. Shiseido for lighter days and Lancome for longer nights. Both wear very well and up to 7hours with minimal powdering. I do have to blot though since I'm so oily you can literally fry tempura on my face. But both don't cling to dry patches and have very natural looks.Worst: MUFE HD (new formula). IT IS SO CAKEY and doesn't sink in. Also oxidizes like crazy, clings onto dry patches, and overall just made me look like I was drenched in stage makeup. It also looks muddy and doesn't take powders well. \n",

      "Oily skin gal here! .Best: It's been said over 582946 times but seriously, the Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation it's the best foundation I've ever tried. It's full coverage but can be sheered out, wide shade range and doesn't oxidize. Very matte finish but you can use a drop of a beauty oil to give it more of a natural finish. I can get away with 7 hours without using powder or a mattifying primer and it applies very smooth with a brush or a BB (I prefer a brush). The only thing that I don't like is the fact that it clings to dry patches and can accentuate texture but overall it's a solid 9/10.Worst: BareMinerals Pure Brightening Serum Spf 20. Oh my God! I know this foundation isn't targeted towards oily skin but even so, I always use a mattifying and pore filling primer and powder for any foundation I use but this won't stick to my skin. Poor coverage despite the fact that it claims to be buildable (not true), poor shade range, not long wearing at all (I got 5 hours of use and it was already sliding off my face), not transfer resistant, sinks into pores and accentuates texture like a mofo. The only thing I like about this it's that is very hydrating and it doesn't cling into dry patches. 2/10\n",

Besides the fact the colors are super pink and not light enough, I was immediately unimpressed as soon as I put it on my face. The liquid mousse idea was intriguing, but it was just a basic liquid foundation. No enhancing properties. It was kind of thick and didn't look natural. I felt uninspired after I had applied it.

It’s insane how many improvements it provided.Apple typically has camera years, performance years, new hardware feature years, new hardware UI input years, case redesign years, new display years, and improved connectivity years. Usually a new iPhone will focus on maybe 2-3 of those 7 categories, and then the next year they’ll focus on 2 more. The iPhone 6S got 5 of the 7 categories. It was truly a *massive* upgrade.Perhaps that explains why the iPhone 6 was such a small upgrade.

      "I’m glad to see the 6S is getting some love in this thread. It was one of the greatest iPhones ever and easily the most underrated. It was especially interesting because it came right after the iPhone 6, which was the worst iPhone ever. The 6S was visually the same, but boy was it ever different on the inside.If I had to rank the flagship iPhones from best to worst, in terms of how impressive they were at the time of release, I’d go something like this:.**Tier 1:** iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone X.**Tier 2:** iPhone 5, iPhone 6S.**Tier 3:** iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, iPhone 7.**Tier 4:** iPhone 3GS, iPhone XS, iPhone 3G.**Tier 5:** iPhone 6.Those are also roughly in order of best to worst within each tier.

      "Keep in mind we’re speaking in relative terms, not absolute terms. It’s about how the phone was at the time of its release.The iPhone X was a massive improvement over the previous year’s iPhone 7, in everything from design (full screen, Face ID, new gesture system) to the display (OLED) to the materials used (stainless steel rather than aluminum). It was also a big camera upgrade, a decent performance upgrade, and a nice improvement in battery life.The XS offered none of that. It was the same design, the performance boost was minuscule (ie. the CPU gain was 15%, which is the smallest ever for an iPhone), and even the RAM felt limited. It increased from 3GB to 4GB, but it sure didn’t feel like it. If you compare the X and XS, the list of improvements is pretty paltry. Some of the ‘headline’ upgrades are the fact that it went from IP67 to IP68, and the fact that the Neural Engine was improved. Pretty minor stuff from a user’s point of view.Also, the battery actually got *worse*, and in many ways, so did the camera. If you read the camera reviews, the XS wasn’t some incremental upgrade, but rather, the camera system was completely redesigned. And while this redesign helped a bit with low light photos, it also made everything flatter and more washed out. So even in absolute terms, it was worse in some ways.Basically, the XS had two things going against it. Firstly, the improvements over the X were very minor, and secondly, in some cases, it actually got *worse* (battery life and daytime photography).Taken together, owning an iPhone XS in 2018 was nowhere near as good an experience as owning an iPhone X in 2017. I’ve owned every flagship iPhone since the 4S in 2011, and the XS was the first and only time I actually regretted buying the new one. Looking back, I would have rather saved my money and gone another year with the X until picking up the 11 Pro.Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a good phone (after all, it’s an iPhone), but if we’re ranking iPhones from best to worse, it’s definitely one of the least impressive releases.\n",
